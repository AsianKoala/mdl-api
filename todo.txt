- Implement Schemas in CRUD
- Watchlist
- Cast
- Actors
- Migrate to SQLAlchemy 2.0 Mapped annotations
- Maybe add POST endpoints for pre populating? (Not sure of typical solution)
- Fix parse_user_info (see id=735043-life). Does not work dramas that have not been released
- Change watchlist's drama GET schema so I don't send a 6000 line json on watchlist endpoint
- Add error handling on parsers
- Add limit/search/etc queries on watchlist (maybe make a new router? not sure)
